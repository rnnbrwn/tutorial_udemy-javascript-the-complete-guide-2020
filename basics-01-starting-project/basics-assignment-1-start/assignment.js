// Create two variables: One that holds a fictional user input (a number of your choice) and one that holds no value initially (e.g. "result").

let fictionalUserInput = 10;
let result;

// Set the result variable to 18 plus the value stored in user input.

result = 18 + fictionalUserInput;

// Add three additional lines of code where you change the result variable again (by subtracting a value of your choice, multiplying it and dividing it).

result = 100 - result;
result = 2 * result;
result = 3 / result;

// Think about the value stored in the user input variable you also created - did that value change?

// RB: No, it did not.

// alert() the result and the user input variables (in two separate alert() calls).
alert(fictionalUserInput);
alert(result);
